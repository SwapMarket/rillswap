# rill-provider

RillSwap provider policy, treasury management, persistence, reconciliation,
watching, and the authoritative cross-repository integration harness.

Status: pre-release and not suitable for real funds.

The provider's first implementation is an append-only SQLite reservation
ledger. Its explicit `create` operation refuses existing files and remains
unreconciled; `open_existing` never creates or migrates a database. A recorded
reservation atomically covers one complete, immutable, single-cluster input
set. SQLite WAL, synchronous FULL, and a network-bound schema protect local
bookkeeping across ordinary process restarts, subject to SQLite, filesystem,
storage hardware, and backup handling. A missing row or restored snapshot does
not prove a coin is available. The ledger has no coin-selection permission,
release, Core RPC, or funding-ready flag. Funding must remain disabled until a
future wallet/chain and outstanding-intent reconciliation procedure exists.
Deployments sharing treasury coins need coordinated ownership, not just
separate ledgers or application-level network namespaces.

For development alongside the sibling `rill-core` checkout (Python 3.13 or
later, matching its current supported version):

```sh
uv venv --python 3.14 .venv
uv pip install --python .venv/bin/python -r requirements-dev.txt
mkdir -p tmp
.venv/bin/pytest -q --basetemp=tmp/pytest
.venv/bin/mypy src
.venv/bin/ruff check src tests
```

No provider network service or release-safe funding workflow exists yet.
